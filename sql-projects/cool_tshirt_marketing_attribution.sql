CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. 

In this project, youâ€™ll be helping them answer these questions about their campaigns:

1. Get familiar with the company.

How many campaigns and sources do CoolTShirts use and how are they related? Be sure to explain the difference between utm_campaign and utm_source.
What pages are on their website?
2. What is the user journey?

How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many visitors make a purchase?
How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?
What is the typical user journey?
3. Optimize the campaign budget.

CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?

  SELECT user_id,
    MIN(timestamp) 'first_touch'

-- CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings in the project, which should they pick and why?
/* Consider First- and Last-Touch Attribution, CoolTShirts should pick these 5 projects below:

  1. weekly-newsletter
  2. retargetting-ad
  3. retargetting-campaign
  4. paid-search
  5. getting-to-know-cool-tshirts (OR ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts)

  The weekly-newsletter and retargetting-ad campaings are responsible for the highest numbers of last touch on the purchase page. 
The numbers of users making a purchase from these 2 campaigns (115 and 113 respectively) are double higher than other campaigns, followed by retargetting-campaign (54) and paid-search (52). 
  However, for the fifth campaign, it can be either getting-to-know-cool-tshirts or ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts as both are responsible for the same numbers on the purchase page (9). 
Even though the getting-to-know-cool-tshirts has slightly higher numbers of the last touch (232, and 190 for the ten-crazy-cool-tshirts-facts), 
it would be a good idea to consider other perspectives, like comparing the costs of using the sources Nytimes and BuzzFeed.
