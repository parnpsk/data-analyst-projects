/* Project: World Populations SQL Practice I & II - SQLite
Source: codeacademy

Objective: You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.


The population_year table with 2,354 rows and the countries table with 214 rows
